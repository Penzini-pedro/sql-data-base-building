CLEAN, CREATE TABLES, AND QUERYING 

The python method to execute queries and create tables within a python enviroment.

IMPORTS
import pandas as pd
import mysql
import mysql.connector
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

Although i imported all of these you really only need sqlalchemy and pandas

REQUIERMENT
construct 10 queries, construct the tables and database while python is used to comunicate with the server

CONTENT
inside the folder you can find two folders one is the original copy and the other is a deliverable final proyect

inside deliverable you can find the diagram i reversed engenired to mkae my queries, my code in a python file, my code in jupyter format, the cleaned data my code produced, git ignore just in case, and the dirty data i got from the original folder 

Troubles and doubts:
while querying although i know its possible i couldnt call on a temporary table but could build one
